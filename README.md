# ecs-fargate-poc
end‑to‑end POC implementation plan for Amazon ECS (Fargate) with a ready‑to‑run Terraform setup and minimal operational overhead. It deploys a stateless web service behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets (no NAT Gateway cost), using Fargate (serverless containers) for simplicity.
